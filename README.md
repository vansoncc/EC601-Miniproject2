# EC601-Miniproject2
This is the Mini project for the EC601 to use the tensorFlow to recognize two class class flowers

## Steps to use
### 1.Down load the dataset from the kaggle
  I used the flower dataset and choosed the two class flowers(Rose and daisy)
  I built up the model basiclly similar with the cifar-10 model

### 2.Used 90% image as trainning set, and 10% images used for test
  
### 3.Install the tensorflow 
  This project use the tensorflow to build up the model and train the model
### 4. The whole project have three part:
    Input data : read and resize the images
    model: Build up the trainning model
    Training and Testing : trainning the model and test the accuracy

ã€€## Result and graph
