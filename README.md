# EC601-Miniproject2
This is the Mini project for the EC601 to use the tensorFlow to recognize two class class flowers

Steps to use
1.Down load the dataset from the kaggle
  I used the flower dataset and choosed the two class flowers(Rose and daisy)

2.Used 90% image as trainning set, and 10% images used for test
  
3.Install the tensorflow 
  This project use the tensorflow to build up the model and train the model
3. The whole project have three part:
    Input data : read and resize the images
    model: Build up the trainning model
    Training and Testing : trainning the model and test the accuracy
